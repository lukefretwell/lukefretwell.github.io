I’m grateful to my family for allowing me to have this time.</p>

<p>In November, I stepped away from my role at <a href="https://proudcity.com">ProudCity</a>. This has given me space to think about my work, reconnect with people that matter to me, establish new relationships, find the threads, and intentionally explore what and who inspires me.</p>

<p>This note stems from my belief we’re all artists and journaling helps you process thoughts and better realize creative direction. Those who have talked with me know I’m a huge fan of Julia Cameron’s “The Artist’s Way” – which advocates journalism as a daily practice. Journaling has always been a great tool for discovery and regeneration.</p>

<p>Albeit more personal than I’m accustomed to, consider this is a journal entry.</p>

<h2 id="taking-stock">Taking stock</h2>

<p>The most meaningful work I’ve done has happened over the past 15 years, focusing on how design, technology and democracy impact and support one another.</p>

<h3 id="govfresh">GovFresh</h3>

<p>Everyone should have a creative sandbox, and mine is <a href="https://govfresh.com">GovFresh</a>.</p>

<p>Initially, it started as an aggregated view of official government RSS and social media feeds. After visiting federal government websites and seeing the disconnect between Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C., I began blogging about government and technology.</p>

<p>Since then, GovFresh has served as a place for me to share thoughts, code, design, learn and engage with others.</p>

<h3 id="govpress">GovPress</h3>

<p>In 2010, working with Dustin, I built a WordPress theme for the Manor website. Initially, this started as a web design project just for the city, but we both quickly realized it could easily be repurposed for other governments who couldn’t afford expensive web services.</p>

<p>Eventually, Devin Price and I developed <a href="https://lukefretwell.com/work/govpress">GovPress</a>, a WordPress theme for government. Though the theme and repository are now inactive and archived, still today there are thousands of active installations.</p>

<p>I learned from GovPress the power of open source and its potential to exponentially solve government technology problems. It was the beginning of a realization that I still hold today: open source is the future of great democracy technology.</p>

<p>Gratitude: Devin Price</p>

<h3 id="manorgovfresh">Manor.GovFresh</h3>

<p>The early days of Gov 2.0 or open government (what we now call civic tech) were magical. For me, one of those moments was co-hosting an event with the City of Manor, Texas. At the time, , was the 20-something chief innovation officer working to inspire local governments to adopt affordable, collaborative tools. Dustin is now president of <a href="https://www.erepublic.com/">e.Republic</a>, including Government Technology, Governing and the Center for Digital Government.</p>

<p>Dustin and I organized a two-day event, Manor.GovFresh, that brought together around 100 Austin area government officials, civic innovators, entrepreneurs, and even someone from The White House, to share how this was possible. Some of the folks there went on to become influential voices and leaders in civic technology and still reference that event as special (one as recent as last week).</p>

<p>(Side note: Sometime later, President Obama visited Manor New Tech High School where Manor.GovFresh was held.)</p>

<p>Gratitude:</p>

<h3 id="citycamp">CityCamp</h3>

<p>The first <a href="https://lukefretwell.com/work/citycamp">CityCamp</a> was organized by Kevin Curry and Jen Pahlka in January 2010 in Chicago. It was part barcamp, part hackathon and was another one of those special moments.</p>

<p>Afterwards, others began asking about holding a CityCamp in their city. Kevin Curry (founder of Code for America Brigades) and I worked together (over Skype, beers and a three-hour time difference) and developed a strategy that would <a href="https://opensource.com/government/11/5/how-citycamp-became-open-source-brand">open source the brand</a> so other cities could easily replicate the format locally. Ultimately, 20 cities worldwide held CityCamps. For a few years, it was a source of connection between civic hackers and local government, but also for civic technologists globally.</p>

<p>Gratitude:</p>

<h3 id="fedscoopstatescoop">FedScoop/StateScoop</h3>

<p>and I met virtually during the early days of Gov 2.0.</p>

<p>Today, Scoop News Group is a leading government technology media company. I’m in awe of, but not surprised by, what Goldy has built.</p>

<p>Gratitude:</p>

<h3 id="nucivic">NuCivic</h3>

<p>was one of the first, if not the first, government chief information officer to lead on open source, actively adopting and championing its usefulness. Andrew went on to start a company, initially named Nuams (short for New Amsterdam Ideas), to build what he called OpenSaaS tools for government.</p>

<p>The primary offering was <a href="https://getdkan.org/">DKAN</a>, a cloud-based open source open data platform for governments and nonprofit organizations. DKAN is still used by organizations globally, including U.S. federal government agencies.</p>

<p>The NuCivic team was passionate and scrappy. NuCivic was acquired by GovDelivery, which was then acquired by Granicus.</p>

<p>Gratitude to: , Federica Pelzel, Teófilo Sibileau, Sheldon Rampton, Janette Day, Dan Feder, Aaron Couch, Jim Craner</p>

<h3 id="civicactions">CivicActions</h3>

<p>Gratitude: ,</p>

<h3 id="civicdmv">CivicDMV</h3>

<p><a href="https://civicdmv.org/">CivicDMV</a> was a relatively short project to re-imagine how the Department of Motor Vehicles could do digital. Rachel Kroft and I worked together with a small group of other folks to prototype and socialize how DMV could be different. This work inspired the California DMV to move forward on digital transformation efforts.</p>

<p>With CivicDMV, I learned that even a small nudge can spark big changes.</p>

<p>Gratitude: Rachel Kroft</p>

<h3 id="code-california">Code California</h3>

<p>With the California Government Operations Agency (aka Angie Quirarte), I developed<a href="https://go.code.ca.gov"> Code California</a>, a resource to help state employees adopt open source software and culture. It’s since evolved into something different, but the two of us learned a lot about key concepts of open source and, by working in GitHub, it laid the foundation for how we’d work on another endeavor that would come to have even more impact.</p>

<p>Gratitude: Angie Quirarte</p>

<h3 id="agile-government-leadership">Agile Government Leadership</h3>

<p>In 2014, working with CivicActions, I started Agile Government Leadership as an open community of practice to bring together government and industry leaders to support, learn and collaborate around themes such as agile project management, open source, procurements and human-centered design.</p>

<p>I worked closely with Elizabeth Raley and , building the website, creating community, coordinating contributor white papers, hosting virtual conversations with digital service early adopters and all the little things you do to build a movement.</p>

<p>AGL has since re-branded as<a href="https://www.publicgood.tech/"> Technologists for the Public Good</a> and is now an official nonprofit organization.</p>

<p>Gratitude to:</p>

<h3 id="the-government-we-need">The Government We Need</h3>

<p>In 2019, I put a call out asking if anyone was interested in starting a civic technology podcast. Jessica MacLeod responded, and we called it The Government We Need. While we weren’t prolific (my fault), those interviews are now preserved on <a href="https://govfresh.com/podcast">GovFresh</a>. Jess is thoughtful, intuitive and conversational, and I always enjoyed collaborating with her on each episode.</p>

<p>Gratitude: Jessica MacLeod</p>

<h3 id="california-wildfire-response-and-recovery">California wildfire response and recovery</h3>

<p>When wildfires broke out in Santa Rosa and Paradise, ProudCity quickly stood up web presences so local officials could effectively communicate with their communities during two of the most devastating disasters in California history.</p>

<p>By no means were we on the front lines, but it’s impossible to not feel the sense of urgency and anxiety for those who were. I’ll never forget working on the Paradise/Butte County response website from my kitchen island, smelling smoke coming from who knows where hours away, feeling fortunate I could get a relatively good night’s sleep, knowing that those on the front lines were running on adrenaline and a deep sense of duty to their communities.</p>

<p>During one of those times, we were in the middle of our onboarding process for the City of Sonoma. Sonoma’s then city manager was decisive on what needed to happen to expedite the new site’s launch. I’m still in awe of her sense of calm and direction during that time.</p>

<p>Through those experiences, I learned that we need better digital resilience in disaster response efforts, and that there’s still more work to be done there. I also learned the superpower of both the people who care deeply about their communities, but also volunteers that care deeply about people.</p>

<p>Gratitude to: Jake Bayless, Talia Smith, , Christine Foster, Kevin Herman</p>

<h3 id="california-alpha">California Alpha</h3>

<p>In 2020, Angie Quirarte called me one night to let me know about an experimental project California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office (read ) approved. The idea was to create a small team for a three-month cycle, called <a href="https://alpha.ca.gov">Alpha</a>, that would re-imagine how the state could do digital service.</p>

<p>Angie asked me to serve as product designer, but also to help coach the team on working in the open. While it was a short timeframe, it was the incubator for what is now California’s <a href="https://innovation.ca.gov/">Office of Data and Innovation</a>. It was an honor to work with that team and an opportunity of a lifetime.</p>

<p>On Alpha, I learned about the need for crucial conversations and the importance of baking in the big picture practices with the day-to-day  of delivery.</p>

<p>Gratitude: Angie Quirarte, , Art Khomishen, JP Petrucione, Aaron Hans, Kimberly Glenn, Chad Bratton, Carter Medlin, Rebecca Huval,</p>

<h3 id="accessibility-and-openocr">Accessibility and OpenOCR</h3>

<h3 id="proudcity">ProudCity</h3>

<p>When we started <a href="https://proudcity.com">ProudCity</a>, we wanted to bring continuously improving, cost-effective, open software solutions to local governments. While small communities desperately needed it then, they need this more than ever today.</p>

<p>Founding and bootstrapping a government technology company is hard. You learn about yourself, your co-founders and business. You meet great people who genuinely care about the communities they serve. You discover that government technology entrepreneurs are public servants in their own right and often don’t get the credit they deserve.</p>

<p>Today, ProudCity serves more than 100 government organizations across the United States and is consistently honored by Government Technology as a GovTech 100 company. I’m proud of what we’ve built and how we’ve built it. I’m biased, but it’s the best government technology company in the world, and I’m excited to see how it grows beyond me.</p>

<p>Gratitude to: Kevin Herman, Jeff Lyon, Alex Schmoe</p>

<h3 id="department-of-civic-things">Department of Civic Things</h3>

<p>I first met when she was a program analyst charged with revamping the City of San Rafael’s website. Those initial conversations about software-as-a-service and government procurement planted the seeds to a personal and professional relationship.</p>

<p>Today, Rebecca is the CEO of the <a href="https://deptofcivicthings.com">Department of Civic Things</a>, a government content design service. We joke about it now, but initially Rebecca was incorporated as REDACTED. I reached out to her to chat about branding and suggested she take a broader approach. We had several conversations about what best aligned with. Ultimately, she landed on DoCT.</p>

<p>After prototyping a logo, she ran with it (faster than I was expecting). Today, DoCT is a thriving content service provider for local governments. Rebecca is an incredible person, and I’m proud to have been part of DoCT’s genesis.</p>

<p>Gratitude:</p>

<h3 id="proudly-serving">Proudly Serving</h3>

<p>At some point, I had an idea to write a book for local governments, helping them understand and adopt a culture of digital. It didn’t happen. I reached out to to co-write it, and we still couldn’t get it off the ground. We then reached out to and and everything began to click into place.</p>

<p><a href="https://proudlyservingbook.com">Proudly Serving</a> is a true open, collaborative editorial project. While it’s been Rebecca and I from the beginning, others have been deeply involved at times and have been crucial to its progress.</p>

<p>While it has taken much longer than I expected (forever?), the final product is something that will be a timeless, invaluable resource that helps government officials understand what it means to have a digital service culture.</p>

<p>Gratitude to: Morgan Griffin</p>

<h3 id="humans-of-public-service">Humans of Public Service</h3>

<p>The first time I met was on a virtual call while on vacation. He shared his idea for Humans of Public Service, and I remember telling him his wife would divorce him if he hired a photographer for every featured nominee. We brainstormed low-hurdle options, and he landed on what HOPS is today.</p>

<p>That’s the extent of my contribution until recently we’ve started meeting to think (and execute) operationally about how he can take it to the next level. Brian is infectiously joyful, and I look forward to working with him more.</p>

<p>Gratitude:</p>

<h3 id="scangov">ScanGov</h3>

<p>My son Elias and I began coding together during COVID. We first built projects that now reside on <a href="USA.GovFresh.com">usa.govfresh.com</a>.</p>

<p>This past year, we built <a href="https://scangov.org">ScanGov</a> to help federal and state government agencies understand key web standards and how they fared. It’s been inspiring to watch him engage with government folks on GitHub (most of whom probably don’t realize they’re collaborating with a teenager), helping to improve their websites. We’ve talked with government officials and <a href="https://docs.scangov.org/press">shared our story with industry press</a>.</p>

<p>With ScanGov, I’ve learned deeper about how you can impact bureaucratic change from the outside. Unfortunately, the culture of government isn’t great about recognizing the public service of those beyond the walls of bureaucracy, but I know some of what our impact has had and am proud of the way Elias has built and managed it.</p>

<p>Gratitude: Elias, Aaron Hans</p>

<h2 id="et-al">Et al</h2>

<p>Plus these folks for friendship, camaraderie and service with principles: Steve Spiker, Brian Purchia Alex Howard Joe Morris, Hillary Hartley,,Camille Tuutti, Ido Ivry, Adriel Hampton, Ryan Wold, Beth Archibald, Mai-ling Garcia, Lawrence Grodeska, Mike Gifford, Ryan Ko, Carla Briceno, Greg Elin, Syed Azeem.</p>

<p>And the journalists who have included me in their stories: Nancy Scola, Paul Taylor, Keeley Quinlan, , Troy Schneider, Dennis Noone, Ben Miller and others.</p>

<h2 id="this-i-believe">This I believe</h2>

<p>Years ago, NPR had this feature called “<a href="https://www.npr.org/series/4538138/this-i-believe">This I Believe</a>” that I loved. They were short audio narrations that a person would poignantly share about an anecdote and how it tied into their perspective on life.</p>

<p>While simplistic and less profound, this is what I believe:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Technology is important.</li>
  <li>People are important.</li>
  <li>Together, good technology and people can do great things.</li>
  <li>Public service comes in many forms.</li>
</ul>

<p>I also believe in seeing life , your work is a canvas waiting to be filled. Julia Cameron’s “The Artist’s Way”, Rick Rubin’s “The Creative Act: A Way of Being”, Steven Pressfield’s “The War of Art”, and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s “Flow” and “Creativity”.</p>

<p>My acronym is JFDI. Once at a Code for America happy hour, we I asked, “What is JFDI?” I believe it was Keven Curry that said, “Just f***ing do it.”</p>

<p>Since then, it’s been the perfect acronym to describe my philosophy on impact. Momentum is everything. JFDI.</p>

<h2 id="im-lucky">I’m lucky</h2>

<p>For some reason, I’ve had the good fortune of working with amazing people on amazing things. Some have gone nowhere, while others have far surpassed my expectations of their potential (usually after I’d moved on). I’m proud of my work and honored to have done it with people I respect and admire. I’m embarrassingly lucky and extremely grateful.</p>
