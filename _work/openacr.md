I worked with CivicActions to establish an internal [accessibility open community of practice](https://accessibility.civicactions.com/). From that work, I wrote [an opinion piece on the need for accessibility compliance as code](ps://www.route-fifty.com/digital-government/2021/02/the-need-for-accessibility-compliance-as-code/315514/). The community of practice work coupled with the editorial led to conversations with General Services Administration and eventual contract to build what is now [OpenACR](https://acreditor.section508.gov/), a machine-readable accessibility conformance report.
