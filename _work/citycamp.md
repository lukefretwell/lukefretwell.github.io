The first [CityCamp](https://citycamp.com) -- an unconference focused on cities and civic technology -- was held January 23-24, 2010, in Chicago, organized by Kevin Curry and Jen Pahlka. Afterwards, Kevin and I developed it as an open source brand so that anyone could host events anywhere. Since then, there have been self-organized CityCamp events worldwide.
