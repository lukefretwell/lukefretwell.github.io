In 2019, I served as product designer supporting the Alpha.CA.gov project, a 90-day experiment by the State of California to re-imagine CA.gov with and for the people of California. Also mentored the team on open culture (working publicly, using appropriate tools) and helped craft and deliver the project narrative.
