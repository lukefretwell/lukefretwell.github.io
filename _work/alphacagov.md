From December 2019 to March 2020, I served as product designer on the [California Alpha](https://alpha.ca.gov/) project, a three-month, 14-person team experiment by the State of California to re-imagine CA.gov using open culture principles and agile development practices. I supported product design, helped craft and deliver the project narrative, and mentored the team on accessibility and working in the open. Immediately after the project ended, this work and key team members were instrumental in leading the state's COVID-19 digital response efforts.
