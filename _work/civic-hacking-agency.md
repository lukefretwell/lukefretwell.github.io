During the COVID-19 pandemic, my son Elias and I began coding together as part of what we call the [Civic Hacking Agency](https://civichackingagency.org). Pojects include a [congressional directory](https://civichackingagency.org/projects/congress) using Congress.gov API, a [survey marker finder](https://usa.govfresh.com/geomarks/) using National Geodetic Survey data, and [ScanGov](/work/scangov). More at [USA.govfresh.com](https://usa.govfresh.com).
