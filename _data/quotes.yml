- quote: "I've had the honor of calling Luke a friend and colleague for almost 10 years. He is a fierceful partner and champion of openness, collaboration, and civic engagement in our public interest tech ecosystem. Most of the work he does has directly supported the foundations of civic tech from starting his own company and making it easier for local governments to spin up websites at low cost, to launching communication and engagement campaigns like CivicDMV, to championing good tech like open source code in initiatives like Code California and now ScanGov. Luke challenges the status quo and empowers public servants and technologists to embrace new ways of working and get things done. Anyone that has the pleasure of working with Luke can say he cares about you as a human and nudges you to be better, myself included."
